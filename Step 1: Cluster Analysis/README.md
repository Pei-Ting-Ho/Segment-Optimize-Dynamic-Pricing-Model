# Cluster Analysis

## Text File
Here, I explore the clustering methods, grouping scientific note / personal understanding into 3 sections:

- **Brief Introduction: Clustering Concept**
- **Data Type: Categorical Data**
- **Evaluation Criteria**

## Code File
Here, I perform the data manipulation and implement the clustering methods. Specifically, several R packages are heavily used to help achieve the desired result:
- **The `dplyr` package**: For the convenient piping workflow and the useful verbs usage 
- **The `purrr` package**: For the simple yet efficient iteration (The `map_*()` functions)
- **The `dummies` package**: For transforming categorical attributes to binary attributes  
- **The `factoextra`, `gridExtra`, and `ggplot2` packages**: For visualizing clustering results and combining several subplots
- **The `klaR` package**: For performing the k-modes clustering
