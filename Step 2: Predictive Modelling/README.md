# Predictive Modelling

## Text File
Here, I study the cross validation approaches, grouping scientific note / personal understanding into 3 sections:

- **Brief Introduction: Regression Analysis**
- **Brief Discussion: Cross Validation**
- **Approach Adopted**

## Code File
Here, I perform the data modelling. Specifically, several R packages are heavily used to help achieve the desired result:

- **The `dplyr` package**: For the convenient piping workflow and the useful verbs usage 
- **The `purrr` package**: For the simple yet efficient iteration (The `map_*()` functions)
- **The `caret` package**: For streamlining the predictive modeling process
- **The `moderndive` package**: For performing the regression analysis with the simple wrapper functions 
- **The `ggplot2` and `gridExtra` packages**: For visualizing price-response relationship and combining several subplots
